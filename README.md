# Peridigm
Peridigm is an open-source computational peridynamics code developed at Sandia National Laboratories for massively-parallel multi-physics simulations.  It has been applied primarily to problems in solid mechanics involving pervasive material failure.  Peridigm is a C++ code utilizing foundational software components from Sandia's Trilinos project and is fully compatible with the Cubit mesh generator and Paraview visualization code.

Our work will be based on this and also the work done by John Foster.
